#How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

The total votes cast in this election was 369,711.

In all three county areas, we helped election commission to get the percentage and total number votes so that commission would realize the popularity of candidates and this local congressional election.

Jefferson had 38,855 with 10.5% where as Arapahoe had 24,801 with 6.7% and Denver had 306,055 with 82.8%.

Election commission asked to specify the results based on each candidate number and percentage of votes as well.

Charles Casper Stockham got 23% with 85,214 as compare to Ramon Anthony who got only 3.1% with 11,606 votes. Diana DeGette got 73.8% with 272,892.

#Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

We can see clearly from above number that Diana is the successful candidate and won this election with highest number of votes in all the county areas.

#Summary

To summarize this analysis we learned and helped Seth and Tom to make this local election analysis successful, concise and readable manner for whole commission people.
This audit can be proposed for future election audit by commission people. This will save their time and can give accurate results as well.

Some modifications can be recommend with calculating the lowest voting areas. That means if any county area is not involved in 100% of voting the candidates then we can use the if statement with for loop to identify the county areas with lowest rating.

Also, another option is for election commission to compare the results of same candidate for couple of years using for loop to know the output of one candidate.
